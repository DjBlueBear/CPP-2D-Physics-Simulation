#CPP-2D-Physics-Simulation
Physics are simulated in C++ and the positions of each object is saved to a text file at each frame
This file is sent to a Python script to then display the simulation
(Made in CodeHS: https://codehs.com/sandbox/id/c-2d-physics-simulation-jUIDFQ)
(I know this isnt a very good way of displaying graphics but i dont know how to get graphics in C++ (yet))
